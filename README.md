## Quantum Circuits Notebooks
find the attached jupyter notebooks Of quantum circuits I programmed and tested on the IBM Quantum Lab:
- **Adder(n):** This notebook contains a quantum circuit for addition.
- **Sub(n):** This notebook contains a quantum circuit for subtraction.
- **MODADD(3):** This notebook contains a quantum circuit for modular adder of (a + b) mod N where a and b 3 qubits and N 4 bits.

Please, Let me know if any modification is required.
